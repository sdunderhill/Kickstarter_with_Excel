## Excel Challenge for Crowd Funding
### To show Louise the different outcomes of fundraising campaigns based on their launch dates and their funding goals

In general, the lower the goal the higher percentage of success. Campaigns with goals less than $4,999 had the highest percentage of success with an average 75% rate of success. However, there is a small group in the $35,000 to $44,999 goal range that also had a high percentage of success with an average of 67% success rate. It is difficult to compare the two though because the total number of events differ vastly. There were a total of 720 total campaigns that were $4,999 or less. With a total of 9 campaigns in the $35,000 to $44,999 range. 

When you look at the timing, May is the best month for launching a theatre campaign due to the highest level of success. When narrowed down to just plays, the success rate in May is 93%. However it is also the highest failed rate month with 42%. This is also the month with the highest number of launch dates. June and July follow the closest in successes and total number of campaigns launched. 

To dig deeper into the reason for the differences in the success rate based on goals, data on the targeted group of contributors would be necessary to see how that affects the outcomes.
